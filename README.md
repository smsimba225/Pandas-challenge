## Pandas Challenge Readme!

Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

This assignment was an in-depth look into cleaning and manipulating data, as well as creating, merging and formatting Pandas Data Frames.  Pandas is an extremely powerful too that enables us to compare different portions of data in order to draw conclusions.  

The most challenging part of this exercise was working with various datatypes.  It was important for me to make sure that I did not format a DataFrame until after I was done with manipulating the data.  I ended up also having to copy a Data Frame because it was being used later in the exercise, but I wanted to format the Data Frame to match the examples given.

Grouping the data by different criteria allowed us to see a bigger picture of what was happening within the data.  It was interesting to see that Grade Level did not seem to affect test scores, and also that small and medium sized schools had similar scores, while contrasting with the much lower scores in the Large schools.

Thank you for looking at my work!  I learned a lot from this challenge.
